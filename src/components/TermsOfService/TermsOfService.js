We shall refund the Fee paid by the Customer together with the Commission due. The Customer has no right to cancel unless set out in the Supplier Terms.</p>
    <h2>6. Marketplace</h2>

    <p>6.2 The Supplier is entitled to and encouraged to upload to the Site its Supplier Terms. The Customer should carefully read the Supplier Terms before agreeing to hire any item or service. Each of the parties must agree to the Supplier Terms and to any changes made to the Supplier Terms at any time.

    <p>6.3 The Supplier shall make clear the Fee due, either on the Marketplace and/or within the Supplier Terms.</p>
    <p>6.4 The Supplier can remove a listing or cancel its agreement to lend Equipment to a Customer at any time up to 48 hours before the start of the relevant hire period. If the Supplier cancels an agreement to hire Equipment to a Customer less than 48 hours before the start of the hire period, we may charge the Supplier a cancellation fee equal to 30% of the relevant Fee.

    <h2>12. Fees and Commission</h2>
    <p>12.1 The payment processing services on the Site are provided PayPal and are subject to their terms of use. As a condition of SetPatrol enabling payment processing services, you agree to provide SetPatrol accurate and complete information, and you authorise SetPatrol to share such information and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by PayPal. We may change our payment services provider at any time, and for the avoidance of doubt, you agree that we are not liable for the acts or omissions of our payment service provider.</p>

    <p>13.3 For 12 months following completion of any hire under these Terms, if the Customer engages the same Supplier to provide items/services, the Supplier shall notify SetPatrol accordingly and the Commission set out in Condition 12 shall continue to be due from each of the Customer and the Supplier. SetPatrol shall on reasonable notice to the Supplier be entitled to audit all payment records relating to a Customer that has been introduced to the Supplier by SetPatrol to ensure full and accurate disclosure and payment of all Commission due to SetPatrol. This audit right shall continue in place for 12 months following termination of the Supplier’s participation on the Site.

    <p>13.4 Any breach of this Condition 13 shall constitute a material breach of these Terms, and SetPatrol shall be entitled to suspend or terminate a user’s account and claim appropriate damages in respect of any loss suffered as a result</p>
    <h2>14. Termination or Suspension</h2>
