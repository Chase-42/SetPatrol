            <h2>SetPatrol Buy & Sell Listing Conditions</h2>
            <p>Sellers are responsible for setting accurate Listing conditions and descriptions.</p>
            <p>SetPatrol has the following Listing conditions that a Seller can set:</p>
            <h3>Brand New</h3>
            <p>A brand-new, unused, unopened item in its original packaging (where applicable).</p>
            <h3>Like New</h3>
            <p>Pre-owned equipment, but appears as new. There are no signs of wear on the item.</p>
            <h3>Very Good</h3>
            <p>Very minor cosmetic damage on the body of the equipment, but nothing that interferes with the functionality of the equipment. Equipment works perfectly.</p>
            <h3>Good</h3>
            <p>Shows signs of use. Some cosmetic damage such as scrapes, scratches, or dings. Functions perfectly.</p>
            <h3>Acceptable</h3>
            <p>Shows signs of heavy use. May have some minor functional issues, which must be clearly described.</p>
            <h3>For Parts</h3>
            <p>Does not function as intended and is not fully operational. This includes items that are defective in ways that render them difficult to use, items that require service or repair, or items missing essential components.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> By default, all Listings are set to ‘Good’ condition to be suitable for rentals.</p>
            <p>Please adjust your Listing condition, if needed, before offering your Listing for sale.</p>
            <h1>SetPatrol Policies</h1>
            <h2>Rental Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>Renters can cancel a Listing rental request before it is accepted, more than 48 hours before the start date, or within 2 hours of the request being accepted and the rental is fully refundable. If the Renter cancels within 48 hours of the rental pick-up date, they will receive a 50% refund. If the Renter cancels within 24 hours of the rental pick-up date, the rental is non-refundable. Rental cancellation fees are imposed at Owner’s discretion.</p>
            <h2>Buy & Sell Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>An offer may be canceled by the Buyer and the Seller before or during the meetup for any reason. The Buyer will be issued a refund for the amount charged. If the Buyer wishes to cancel the transaction after payment has been confirmed at the meetup, the Buyer will be required to request a refund.</p>
            <h2>Buy & Sell 48-Hour Return Policy</h2>
            <p>The Buyer has 48 hours to request a return and refund, for any reason, of their Listing purchase after they pick it up from the Seller. If the item shows any signs of wear, was damaged by the Buyer in any way, or does not include all items originally included in the sale, it will not be eligible for a refund. The Seller agrees to accept the return of the Listing from the Buyer, and agrees to send a full refund to the Buyer, if the Buyer requests a return and refund during these 48 hours. All sales are final 48 hours after the Buyer picks up the Listing, and any returns and refunds after this period are at Seller’s discretion.</p>
            <h2>Taking Rental or Sale Offline</h2>
            <p>The exchange of personal contact information before a rental request or offer has been accepted is not permitted. Any efforts to move rentals or sales initiated on SetPatrol off-site to avoid fees is strictly prohibited and may result in account suspension or termination. Any transaction initiated on SetPatrol but completed off-site will not be protected by any of SetPatrol’s policies or protections.</p>
